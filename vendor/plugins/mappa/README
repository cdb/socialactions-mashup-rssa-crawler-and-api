= Mappa

== Overview 

Mappa is a Rails plug-in map-creation API for creating maps embedded in html web pages. Presently it only supports Google's Gmap2 API.
It was written primarily because of the hacks required to make the Cartographer.rb rails plugin work with the new Gmap2 API. 

Following on from a basic implementation I got frustrated with the amount of javascript I was having to embed within my controller code, a necessity because of the dynamic nature of many of the maps (and map creation techniques) I was using. The result was the latest version of mappa which enables you to build your map javascript from external files.

You need a google API key to use this plugin. This may be obtained by visiting http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html. The API used in this example will suffice for testing as long as you are using the following testing url: http://localhost:3000

This plugin is under constant development but is being used without any problems in production in spotcrime.net. Any amendments, suggestions, etc. are welcomed. 
Further examples of Mappa usage are available at the blog at http://neverintheoffice.net

== Usage
Place the mappa folder into your vendor/plugins directory. There is no need to 'include Mappa' as it's included dynamically with the init.rb

Examples:
=== Basic

The following quick example should produce a basic map.

map_controller.rb :

-------8<-------------------
class MapController < ApplicationController

  def index
    
   @page_title = "Create new map"

   @gmap = Mappa::GMap.new()
   # the gmap api key for localhost:3000 - remember to change this!
   @gmap.api_key = "ABQIAAAArjtwNyA-0TDmcb74hMzhHBTJQa0g3IQ9GZqIMmInSLzwtGDKaBRSDWK-cqMmi3YB5dD-8a6Kwe1Qmg"

   @gmap.lat = 51.775362610
   @gmap.lng = -0.00100011
   @gmap.name = 'gmap'
   @gmap.zoom = 12
   
  end
  
end
